### 🖖 Hi!

🏠 — <https://stefanocoretta.github.io>


I am a postdoc researcher at the [Institute of Phonetics und Speech Processing](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at the Ludwig-Maximilians Universität München (Germany). I obtained my PhD degree in linguistics at the University of Manchester (UK) in 2020 (check out my thesis [here](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/phd-dissertation/)). My area of research is linguistics with a focus on phonetics and phonology—the study of speech sounds and their relation to [*linguisticality*](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.03056) (i.e., Human Language).
