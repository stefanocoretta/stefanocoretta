### üññ Hi!

üè† ‚Äî <https://stefanocoretta.github.io>


I am a postdoc researcher at the [Institute of Phonetics und Speech Processing](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at the Ludwig-Maximilians Universit√§t M√ºnchen (Germany). I obtained my PhD degree in linguistics at the University of Manchester (UK) in 2020 (check out my thesis [here](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/phd-dissertation/)). My area of research is linguistics with a focus on phonetics and phonology---the study of speech sounds and their relation to [*linguisticality*](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.03056) (i.e., Human Language).

Some of the questions my research tries to answer are:

- How do we produce the sounds we use in our daily communication?
- How do these sounds create a system?
- What are the attested sound systems of the languages of the world, and why are they the way they are?
- What can we learn about human cognition from the knowledge of how sound systems work?
